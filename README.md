Couldn't come to class today. Didn't understand what they had done in class. Borrowed CSS code of Vienna. Will look into it myself later.

-- Friday 16 september --
Can't decide what I find harder to do. HTML or CSS. Javascript just makes sense but those two confuse me so much. Did my best to make it work though. Use all the notes and examples of class!

Tried to remove the borrowed file of Vienna. Didn't work out. I don't completely understand how this Github works. Renamed it to something inconspicious (not). 
FIXED: HTML + JS |||
TO DO: CSS + images |||

After over 18 hours of coding, I lack the energy to continue(it's now 3AM, yes this started at 9AM on Thursday). I took some shortcuts (display:block, floats. Yep.) because my brain was out of order. Now time for feedback! I didn't knew what to do with the forms tho... "Yay responsive". Link to the thing:

Deadline time. Tried my best to make the HTML and CSS work. Spoiler alert: it didn't. Whilst being sick I fel evem ore incapable to do all this stuff. Tried my best and a retake it is I guess. My brain has gone to bed way before me now, and my classmates are impressed by my incompentence and how I manage to break EVERYTHING. /applaud me!

So what is wrong:
- missing 2/3 micro interacties, I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end, they didn't seem to work.
- For some reason my images of story 6 bugged out and now only have HALF the text?
- Why is CSS being a CASS?
- Every time I do something to fix the responsiveness, it breaks.
- Probably more but I can't bring my brain to work.


***** IMPORTANT *****
The link which I provided seem to have some issues? It doesn't seem to work on there. I don't know why it is the case, but it IS working locally. Now just to figure out how to fix that for phone..
