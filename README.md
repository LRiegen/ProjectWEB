Couldn't come to class today. Didn't understand what they had done in class. Borrowed CSS code of Vienna. Will look into it myself later.

-- Friday 16 september --
Can't decide what I find harder to do. HTML or CSS. Javascript just makes sense but those two confuse me so much. Did my best to make it work though. Use all the notes and examples of class!

-- Tuesday 20 september --
Tried to remove the borrowed file of Vienna. Didn't work out. I don't completely understand how this Github works. Renamed it to something inconspicious (not). 
FIXED: HTML + JS |||
TO DO: CSS + images |||

After over 18 hours of coding, I lack the energy to continue(it's now 3AM, yes this started at 9AM on Thursday). I took some shortcuts (display:block, floats. Yep.) because my brain was out of order. Now time for feedback! I didn't knew what to do with the forms tho... "Yay responsive".
