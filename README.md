Couldn't come to class today. Missed lesson. Borrowed CSS code of Vienna. Will look into it myself later. 

-- Tuesday 20 september --
Tried to remove the borrowed file of Vienna. Didn't work out. I don't completely understand how this Github works. Renamed it to something inconspicious (not). 
FIXED: HTML + JS
TO DO: CSS + images
